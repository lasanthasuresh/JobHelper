Cover Letter 2:

Score: 8/10

Justification: While this cover letter also covers most of the required experience, the applicant slightly varies from the alignment of the job requirements compared to the first letter. There seems to be little emphasis on the experience with Azure-based systems, event-driven architecture, and mentoring junior engineers. However, the applicant does provide evidence of supervisory duties and an emphasis on producing high-quality, risk-free solutions.
