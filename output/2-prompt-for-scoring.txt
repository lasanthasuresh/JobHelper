Dear Hiring Team at Amused Group,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Suresh Lasantha and I am a seasoned software engineer with over 7 years of experience in back-end development and team leadership, mainly with Java/Kotlin on the Spring framework and ExpressJS on NodeJS. I came across your job posting, and I am eager to apply my learned skills and strong technical knowledge to the challenges at Amused Group.

In my current role as a Technical Team Lead at Allion Technologies Inc., I oversee the design, development, coding, testing, and debugging of Node Express-based integration services. I also have extensive experience in designing and implementing REST API endpoints and ensuring their adhering to best practices - a skill that I believe is directly applicable to building microservice architecture. Having led a team of 8, overseeing their career progression, and conducting training sessions on various topics, I am confident in my ability to facilitate the development and growth of junior engineers at Amused Group.

I also have hands-on experience with AWS, Lambda functions, and even conducting static code reviews for security vulnerabilities in high-critical systems - skills that I believe transfer well into Azure and other core services of your tech stack. I am a fast learner and eager to expand my skills to new technologies like C# dotnet core and terraform, which are integral to your tech stack.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my candidacy further.

Best regards,
Suresh Lasantha
