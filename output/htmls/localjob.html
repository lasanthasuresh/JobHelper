<h2>Cover Letter 1:</h2><div>Dear Hiring Manager at Amused Group,

I am writing to express my interest in the position you advertised. With over 7 years of experience in the tech industry and a Master's degree in Computer Science, I believe I would make a valuable addition to your team.

Your job posting highlights the importance of extensive cloud experience, especially concerning Azure. One of my notable experiences involves designing and developing the back-end of the ORAC project as a Rest API service running on a Kubernetes cluster hosted in GCP. This comprehensive experience makes me highly comfortable with similar Azure services.

Moreover, I bring robust experience with databases like PostgresSQL and MariaDB. With Enactor Pvt. Ltd., I improved troubleshooting efficiency by developing tools and strategies to pinpoint problems quickly using an intuitive graphic UI. I also led the investigation process for application performance/scalability related issues, all while working with databases like MariaDB and MySQL.

In terms of development efficiency and code quality, I have a history of delivering high-quality, testable, and maintainable code. My background in test-driven development and mentorship roles equip me with the skill set necessary to guide the team towards delivering high-quality software.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love to bring my dedication and professionalism to Amused Group as your new senior software engineer. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team, and I am happy to discuss my application further at your earliest convenience.

Best regards, 
Suresh Lasantha

Suresh Lasantha's cover letter clearly outlines his experience and how it matches the job specification. He provides relevant details and examples about past roles and projects that emphasise his skills and familiarity with the technologies we use. Suresh also mentions experience managing databases and working with similar Azure services, which are crucial for the role. However, he does not clearly address his experience in building scalable and self-healing infrastructure in the cloud or comfort with C# dotnet core and terraform. Demonstrated teamwork capability is also missing.

In his second cover letter, Suresh Lasantha again highlights his professional experience and educational background. He makes a clear connection between his previous roles and the required skills for the current job, providing an example of his problem-solving and team leadership skills. However, the letter falls short of specific experiences providing coded solutions and familiarity with C# dotnet core and terraform or infrastructure as code. His experience with databases seems to be limited mainly to PostgresSQL, which was mentioned positively in the previous letter as well.
